# Programming_Languages
Summary of the main features of each programming language (C, C++, C# and Python)

![Programming Languajes](img/Languages.png)

|  Feature    | C Language  | C++ Language  | C# Language | Python Language |
|  :------    | :------------: |:---------------:| :-----:| :-----: |
|  Paradigm   | Procedural, structured programming. | Multi-paradigm (Procedural, Object-Oriented, Generic). | Multi-paradigm (Object-Oriented, Component-Oriented, Functional). | Multi-paradigm (Object-Oriented, Functional, Procedural). |
|  Level      | Low-level (closer to hardware). | Mid-level (balance between low-level control and high-level abstraction). | High-level. | High-level. |
|  Speed      | Very fast, widely used in systems programming. | Almost as fast as C, but with added abstractions. | Optimized but runs on the .NET runtime (not as fast as C/C++). | Slower than C/C++ due to interpretation, but highly productive. |
|  Use Cases  | Operating systems, embedded systems, drivers, compilers. | Game engines, high-performance applications, system/software development. | Desktop apps, enterprise software, web development (ASP.NET), game development (Unity). | Web development, data science, AI/ML, scripting, automation, education. |
|  Strengths  | Direct memory manipulation (pointers). Small runtime. Portability and efficiency. | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Templates and STL (Standard Template Library). Powerful performance with abstraction. | Strongly integrated with Microsoftâ€™s ecosystem. Garbage collection (automatic memory management). Modern syntax and productivity features (LINQ, async/await). |Easy to learn, readable syntax. Huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Dynamic typing and rapid prototyping. |
| Limitations | No object-oriented features. Manual memory management (no garbage collector). | Complex syntax. Memory management can still be tricky. | Heavily tied to .NET/.NET Core. Less control over hardware compared to C/C++. | Slower execution compared to compiled languages. Not ideal for low-level system programming. |
